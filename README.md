# TowerOfHanoi

This is a Java representation of the classic Tower of Hanoi mind puzzler. It utilizes a stack data structure to move the disks from each rod. The user can use commands to move the disks manually, but there is also an included class that recursively solves the puzzle. 

Hanoi.java was created to output a list of all possible moves from a given arrangment of discs and rods
